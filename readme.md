# Rental Management â€“ PS3 - Team Serenity | Odoo Hackathon 2025

A unified platform to manage products and schedule pickups.

## Our Solution
We've developed a versatile rental platform with simplicity at its core:
- **Dual Role System**: Every registered user automatically becomes both a renter and a customer
- **Two-Way Marketplace**: Users can rent items or offer their own products to others
- **Flexible Rental Options**: Choose between short-term or long-term rental agreements
- **Visual Listings**: Upload multiple product images to showcase rental items
